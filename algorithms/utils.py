    :param df: DataFrame containing player data. Expected columns include 'Timestamp (ms)', 'Name', 'Skating Intensity',
               'End Timestamp', and 'Readable Timestamp'. The 'Timestamp (ms)' is used to calculate the duration since

    :param start_time: The start time for the period of interest, measured as minutes since the observation period began.
    :param end_time: The end time for the period of interest, measured as minutes since the observation period began.
